# Energy-Aware Agentic Geo-AI Framework

This repository presents a **conceptual and visual overview** of a research framework for **energy-aware environmental monitoring using agentic Geo-AI**.

The full implementation is part of an ongoing research work and is **not publicly released**. This repository is intended to demonstrate the **design philosophy, decision structure, and empirical outcomes** of the study.

## 🔍 Research Overview

- Decision-centric agent design (no end-to-end policy learning)
- Explicit trade-off between:
  - Energy consumption
  - Spatial coverage
  - Environmental risk
- Lightweight simulation for interpretability and analysis
- Learning used **only for outcome estimation**, not control

---

## 📊 Key Results

### Energy–Coverage Trade-off Across Agents

**Observation:**  
The learning-augmented utility agent achieves a more balanced energy–coverage profile compared to constraint-only and utility-only agents.

### Agent Trajectories Across Environments

**Observation:**  
Agent trajectories adapt to environmental risk and coverage decay, demonstrating decision-driven behavior rather than fixed routing.

## 🧠 Decision Architecture

1. Partial state perception  
2. Rule-based feasibility filtering  
3. Utility-based action evaluation  
4. Optional lightweight outcome estimation  
5. Action execution
